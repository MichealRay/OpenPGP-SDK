3.2 (MPI) doesn't specify what the unused bits should be set
  to. This may be deliberate but I think it should either say they MUST
  be zero (which I prefer) or that their content is unspecified.

4.2 refers to Content Tags, but 4.3 calls them Packet Tags.

5.5.2 doesn't mention V2 keys.

In section 9.1, Schneier is given as the reference for DSA - why not refer to FIPS 186-2, which is freely available? Or, indeed, HAC 11.5.1, available here: http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/about/chap11.pdf.

Similarly 9.2, TripleDES (which, presumably is EDE 3DES - it'd be good
to be specific) is on some FIPS document which I forget or in HAC
chapter 7 (7.32 in 7.2.3 and 7.4.2).

In 5.2.1:

"0x10: Generic certification of a User ID and Public Key packet."

Does this mean that the signature is over the User ID packet and the Public Key packet, concatenated, in that order? Or what?

Also, what on earth does:

       Note that all PGP "key signatures" are this type of
       certification.

mean?

In 5.2.2:

   "The data being signed is hashed, and then the signature type and
   creation time from the signature packet are hashed (5 additional
   octets)."

is unclear, suggest:

"The concatenation of the data to be signed, the signature type and
creation time from the signature packet (5 additional octets) is hashed."
