* Load keyring

* Save keyring

* Generate key

* Add key to keyring

* Find key in loaded keyring (by key ID, by UID)

* Generate subkey

* Revoke subkey

* Delete subkey

* Update subkey

* Delete key from keyring

* Add/remove UID

* Certify UID

* Revoke certification

* Sign message

* Verify, using any key in the keyring

* Verify, using specified key

* Encrypt, using a key

* Decrypt, using a key

* Import any object to GPG/PGP (key, keyring)

* Export any object

* (?)Query keyservers for keys

* (?)Export keys to keyservers

Keyserver stuff will be done if time/budget permits, otherwise will be
a to-do item, since we can always use GPG externally to do it.

Also, "save/load/find/add/import/export keyring" will be pluggable, so
we can use databases instead of flat files and in-memory keyrings.

Note that at least the first phase is not aiming at super-smooth
command-line utilities - these will be good enough for testing, rather
than for general use.
